                Hey! I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dalejsimmons/">Dale</a>. 
                I grew up in the PNW and still live out here today. Growing up, I always had
                interest in the sciences, games, and technology. I grew in my interest for the sciences
                when I attended the University of Washington and received my BS in biology. What started as
                a stats course working with R began my interest in programming and CS. I went on to start 
                self-teaching myself fundamentals of CS through python, but I felt I was missing out on the "why"
                in my studies. I decided to take a few CS courses to learn the "why", and i've developed a large
                interest in coding. I decided to take this bootcamp to help expand my programming knowledge beyond 
                the couple of languages I know and get my foot in the door in the tech industry. Moving forward,
                I would love to develop some games or apps that can be used to bridge two of my developed passions:
                the natural sciences and programming.
